# Open Source Software - Wild and Domesticated
I'm continuously surprised by the complexity and dynamic nature of
today's open source software ecosystem.  As it turns out, writing software
and giving it away is a lot more complicated than it seems.  Just look at
the number of [common open source software licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) in use today that define the terms and conditions under which
the software of a given project can be used.

Part of this complexity reflects a basic tension that has always existed
in the community between the view that software should be a free expression
of thought or speech, and the commercial software industry that creates
products for sale.

There is no doubt that zero-cost open source software has had a fundamental
positive impact on the accessibility of computing resources for the average
user.  This democratizing influence has forced proprietary platforms to open
up, and enabled the rise of platforms like Linux in all of its many forms.
It's hard to imagine how the internet or any cloud-based architecture could
exist without an open source software skeleton.

Ultimately though, everyone has to make a living.  Much of the discussion in 
the community during early days of open source centered around how this could
be accomplished.  Writing open software as a gig wasn't really a thing, and I have
to admit I was skeptic.  As a commercial middleware developer at the time, I
couldn't understand how anyone could afford to devote any meaningful time 
to open source development if they also had a day job to pay the bills.  

The fact is, the commercial embrace of open source has helped the community
a great deal by giving us all viable career path.  But in doing so, they have
created a set of issues that need to be addressed.  The open source and
commercial software communities are destined to disrupt one another in an
endless, sometimes messy cycle, and we all move forward together.

It's useful to view all of this from the perspective of the end user.
